# 🧱 Optional Architectural Approaches

ForgingBlocks is architecture-neutral. It does not require any particular style to be effective.

This section collects **optional examples** showing how ForgingBlocks can participate in various architectural approaches described in literature, such as:

- Clean Architecture
- Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
- Layered Architecture
- CQRS
- Event-Driven designs

Each page:

- summarizes the idea at a high level
- shows how ForgingBlocks building blocks can fit in
- provides one small code example and one diagram
- emphasizes that the style is **optional**, not required
