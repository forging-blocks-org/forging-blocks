# Architectural Styles

## How to read these pages

This section explores **well-known architectural styles** as they appear in the software architecture literature.

These pages are not a source of definitions.
They are intended to help you **relate ForgingBlocks concepts** to architectural styles you may already know.

You can read any page in isolation.
You can also ignore this section entirely.

## What these pages are

Each page in this section:

- Describes a single architectural style.
- Uses neutral, literature-aligned terminology.
- Shows how ForgingBlocks concepts can be *projected* onto that style.

The intent is explanatory, not prescriptive.

---

## What these pages are not

These pages do **not**:

- Define the meaning of Domain, Application, or Infrastructure.
- Impose a preferred architecture.
- Recommend one style over another.

The **Reference** section remains the source of truth for responsibilities and boundaries.

## When this section is useful

You may find this section helpful if you:

- Are familiar with an architectural style and want to map it to ForgingBlocks.
- Want to compare styles using a shared vocabulary.
- Are exploring design trade-offs.

If none of those apply, you can safely skip this section.
