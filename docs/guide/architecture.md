# 🧱 Optional Architectural Approaches

ForgingBlocks does **not** prescribe or depend on any architectural style.

However, many teams like to combine its building blocks with architectures described in books and articles such as:

- Clean Architecture
- Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
- Layered Architecture
- CQRS
- Event-Driven designs

This page serves as a hub for those **optional** examples.

## 🧭 How to Read These Guides

Each architecture-specific page:

- briefly summarizes the style based on established literature
- shows how ForgingBlocks *could* be used within that style
- includes a small code example and a diagram
- emphasizes that the architecture is **optional**, not required

These examples are intended as learning material, not as prescriptions.
