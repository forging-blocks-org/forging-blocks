# Guide
## How to read the documentation

This guide is organized to support different ways of learning.

You can follow the sections in the suggested order below, or jump directly to the parts that are most relevant to you.
You can use **all** of them or only some of them.

## 📚 Learning Path

A common reading path is:

1. **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)** – a small, complete example to get familiar with the toolkit.
2. **[Testing](testing.md)** – how ForgingBlocks encourages explicit, testable designs.
3. **[Example Tests](example_tests.md)** – larger examples that show how those ideas fit together.
4. **[Examples](examples.md)** – focused usage scenarios you can explore independently.
5. **[Principles](principles.md)** – the design values and mindset behind the toolkit.
6. **[Recommended Blocks Structure](recommended_blocks_structure.md)** – guidance on organizing responsibilities and boundaries.
7. **[Release Guide](release_guide.md)** – notes on packaging and releasing projects that use ForgingBlocks.

If you are interested in architectural patterns, you can also explore the
**[Architectural Styles](../architectural-styles/index.md)** section.
Those documents are optional and not required to use the toolkit.
