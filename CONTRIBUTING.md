# Contributing to ForgingBlocks

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ForgingBlocks.

This document explains **how to participate** in the project and where to find the rules that apply once you start contributing.

You do not need to read everything before opening a pull request.
This guide is meant to help you orient yourself.

---

## What you can contribute

Contributions are welcome in several forms, including:

- Bug fixes and improvements
- Documentation clarifications and examples
- New abstractions that align with the existing design
- Tooling, automation, and developer experience improvements

If you are unsure whether an idea fits, opening an issue for discussion is encouraged.

## How the project is structured

ForgingBlocks is organized around **explicit responsibility boundaries**.

The documentation mirrors this structure:

- The **Guide** explains how to read and use the toolkit.
- The **Reference** defines responsibilities and terminology.
- **Architectural Styles** show optional interpretations.
- **Examples** demonstrate usage without prescribing structure.

Understanding this separation will make contributing easier.

## Documentation contributions

Documentation is a first-class concern in this project.

If you plan to modify or add documentation, please read:

- **Docs Conventions**
  `docs/contributing/docs_conventions.md`

That document defines the rules and expectations for documentation changes.

---

## Code contributions

When contributing code:

- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Keep responsibilities explicit.
- Avoid introducing architectural enforcement.
- Add tests where behavior is non-trivial.

If a change affects public behavior, documentation updates are expected.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch with a clear purpose.
3. Make your changes.
4. Open a pull request with a concise description.

Small, focused pull requests are easier to review.

## In short

- This file explains **how to contribute**.
- Other documents explain **how things should be written or structured**.
- When in doubt, ask questions early.

Contributions are welcome as long as they respect the project’s emphasis on clarity, boundaries, and intentional design.
