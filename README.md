## 🌱 Overview

> Not a framework — a **toolkit** of composable contracts and abstractions.

**ForgingBlocks** helps you create codebases that are:
- **Clean** — with clear boundaries and intent
- **Testable** — by design, through explicit interfaces
- **Maintainable** — by isolating concerns and dependencies

It doesn’t dictate your architecture.
Instead, it provides **foundations and reusable** abstractions for **forging** your own **blocks**.

Isolate external concerns from your core logic you will achieve systems that are adaptable and resilient. 
If you **forge** your own **block** you will achieve software with intent and clarity
If you use **blocks** you will achieve consistency and reusability.
**ForgingBlocks** helps you build systems that last.

You can use it to:
- Learn and apply **architecture and design principles**
- Build **decoupled applications** that scale safely
- Model systems with **type safety and explicit intent**
- Experiment with **Clean**, **Hexagonal**, **DDD**, or **Message-Driven** styles

---

## 🧩 Core Concepts

> Foundations, not frameworks — ForgingBlocks provides the *language* for clean architecture.

This toolkit defines **layer-agnostic foundations** that compose into any design:

- `Result`, `Ok`, `Err` → explicit success/failure handling
- `Port`, `InboundPort`, `OutboundPort` → communication boundaries
- `Entity`, `ValueObject`, `AggregateRoot` → domain modeling
- `Repository`, `UnitOfWork` → persistence contracts
- `Event`, `EventBus`, `CommandHandler` → messaging and orchestration

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
poetry add forging-blocks
# or
pip install forging-blocks
# or  
uv add forging-blocks
```

**Requires Python 3.12+**

---

## ⚡ Quick Example

```python
from forging_blocks.foundation import Result, Ok, Err

def divide(a: int, b: int) -> Result[int, str]:
    if b == 0:
        return Err("division by zero")
    return Ok(a // b)

result = divide(10, 2)
if result.is_ok():
    print(result.value)  # → 5
```

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Most systems fail not because of missing features,
but because of **tight coupling**, **implicit dependencies**, and **unclear responsibilities**.

**ForgingBlocks** helps you *design code intentionally* —
so your system remains testable, extensible, and adaptable as it grows.
